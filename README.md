# Garou Training Mode Hack

## IMPORTANT
**This is a hack.**  
**I don't know what are the policies of Steam / SNK / Code Mystics about it.**  
**USE IT BY YOUR OWN RISK.**  


## About

This is a tool that enable some training features in Garou Mark of the Wolves Steam edition.  
The main features are:
  - Display input history
  - Record/Playback inputs
  - Reset position
  
## How to use

Open Garou, choose **Normal Mode** > **Versus** > **Choose the characters** > **Choose the handicap**.  
After the match starts right click on **garou-toremo.exe** then **Run as admnistrator**.  
(At this point you should be able to see the input history.)  
In the **garou-toremo.exe** window press `2 <enter>`, select the device you will use to activate the cheats, then set the hotkeys.  
That's it.

## Features

### Command history display
To show the command the program constantly check the state of current pressed button. As the process is not syncronized with Garou preocess the results might be unprecise sometimes.

### Reset Position
After you set the **hotkey** for **reset position** and **custom position**, you can do the following:
- Press **save custom position** to save your current position
- Press **reset position** to reset position to the previously saved position
- Press **reset position + down** to reset the position to the center
- Press **reset position + left** to reset the position to the left of the screen
- Press **reset position + right** to reset the position to the right of the screen
